# About Leilani

# My name is Leilani Vasquez! I was born and raised in Massachusetts, but my entire family is from the Dominican Republic. I'm very proud of my Latin heritage and love my huge Latin family! I really enjoy spending time with my best friends and my family! I love shopping and self care in my free time aswell.
# I'm currently finishing my associates in IT at Northern Essex Community College, but will be finishing my Bachelors degree at Northeastern University starting in January 2025!
# As it stands, I'm not quite sure what I want to do in the IT field. I have not worked in the field yet, so I'm hoping that with time and an intership or two I'll have more of an idea. I find networking very interesting, and I'm hoping to learn more about it. I will say, though I can do it on a somewhat simple level, coding is not my strong suit. I think it's very interesting, but I can also recognize that it's not my strongest subject.
